This file is my note taking one. I jot down everything I can about CS.

# Object in JS[1]
## Accessing Properties
* With dot notation: testObj.hat (testObj is the Object and hat a property)
* With bracket notation: mostly required if the property has a space. testObj["an entree"]

## Update Propertie
* Dot notation: ourDog.name = "Happy Camper";

## Add New Properties
* Dot notation: ourDog.**bark** = "bow-wow";
* Bracket notation: ourDog['**bark'**] = "woof";

## Delete Properties
Use **delete**: delete myDog.tails;
